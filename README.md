## Overview

### Problem

Coordinating purchases as a group can be annoying. For gift lists for Christmas, birthdays, or weddings, you want to avoid buying the same present as someone else, but having to align with every individual in the group can be a tedious task. Coordination is also required for other group events, like potlucks or large camping trips, where no item wants to be forgotten.

### Objective

Develop a solution that will make group purchasing efforts easier. Whether it's for planning a group event, or for managing gift lists, the tedious inter-group communication is minimized and contributions are recorded and visible to other members.

### Proposed Solution

We plan to develop a web app where users can create a wishlist, and share it with other users. In a wishlist, a user can describe their likes, dislikes and list the specific products they would like to receive. The application will be kept general, so it can be used for gift lists, or for event coordination.
